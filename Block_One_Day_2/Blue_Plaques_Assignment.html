	<h1 id="Header">ABOUT LEEDS BLUE PLAQUES</h1>
	<!--This is paragraph one of the about page-->
	<p id="paragraphone">According to an article written by <a href="https://welcometoleeds.co.uk/article/the-blue-plaque-marking-leeds-history/">
	 Kathy Sharpe</a>, Blue Plaques are signs installed in public places to commemorate 
	 a link between locations and historic persons or events, serving as historical markers.</p>
	<!--This is paragraph one of the about page-->
	<p id="paragraphtwo">Over the years, plaques with varying designs have been administered by different organisations across the UK.
	 Among the plaque schemes, the London Blue Plaque scheme is believed to be the oldest scheme, and currently run by
	 <a href="https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/">English Heritage.</a></p>
	<!--This is paragraph three of the about page-it was defined by paragraph two margin-bottom-->
	<p>Just like in London, Leeds has its own scheme, which is administered by
	<a href="https://leedscivictrust.org.uk/whatwedo/heritage/blue-plaques/">Leeds Civic Trust.</a> The administering of this scheme is not surprising,
	considering the rich and attractive built heritage of the city, which dates back to the time the area was a trading centre for cloth.
	As the interactive map <b>(plaques searched by title)</b> on the left indicates, over 100 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Leeds_Civic_Trust_plaques">Plaques</a> have been erected in the city. Below is a picture taken from one of the commemoration events.

	<!--This is paragraph four of the about page-->
	<p id="paragraphfour">In Leeds, members of the public are involved in the nomination of blue plaques. As this
	<a href="https://livingwithdying.leeds.ac.uk/2021/01/12/leeds-blue-plaques-commemorating-the-lives-of-leeds-people/">Blog</a>
	alludes, public involvement is key to the scheme's transparency, and ensuring that the installed plaques reflect
	the diversity of people and communities across the city.</p>
	<!--This is paragraph five of the about page-it was defined by paragraph four margin-bottom-->
	<p>In summary, the scheme is a good initiative at conserving the heritage of Leeds.</p>
